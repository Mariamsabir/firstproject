            <td>The <a href="">Battle of Lagos</a> took place between a <a href="">British fleet commanded</a> by Edward
                Boscawen and a <a href="">French fleet</a>
                under <a href="">Jean-François de La Clue-Sabran</a> over two days in 1759 during the Seven Years' War.
                They fought
                south west of the Gulf of Cádiz on 18 August and to the east of the <a href="">small Portuguese port of
                    Lagos</a>,
                after which the battle is named, on 19 August.Further information: Planned <a href="">French invasion of
                    Britain</a>
                (1759) and Great Britain in the Seven Years' War.The endemic ill feeling between <a href="">France and
                    Great
                    Britain</a> during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what became
                known as
                the Seven Years' War broke out across <a href="">Europe, pitting France, Austria</a> and <a href="">
                    Russia </a> against <a href="">Britain</a> and
                <a href=""> Prussia</a>. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against <a
                    href="">Prussia,</a> and launched what it
                saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive <a href="">against Britain.[1]</a> The
                <a href="">French possessed 73 ships </a>of the line, the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in
                home waters. The latter were split between the <a href=""> Atlantic port of Brest (22 ships)[11]</a> and the
                Mediterranean port of Toulon, with a small number at two ports on the <a href="">Bay of Biscay:</a> Lorient and
                Rochefort. In total these ships required an <a href="">aggregate complement</a> of about 25,000 men; they were more
                than 9,000 short of this.[12] The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in
                their <a href="">Mediterranean Fleet</a>, which was based in <a href="">Gibraltar</a>.[13]
